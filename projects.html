				<h3>Project Two Objectives</h3>
				
				<p>There are very few instances as a designer—especially when you are getting paid— where you will get the opportunity to make all of the core design decisions on a project without the compromise that comes with outside constraints. More often, you will have art directors, stakeholders, design team members, your clients, and even your client’s users to please, and that leaves very little room to insert your own voice. </p>
				<p>This can be frustrating and defeating, but can offer up some interesting challenges as well. Working outside your comfort zone and figuring out how to work with unfamiliar design structures is one of the best ways to hone your craft.The goal of this project is to make the best site possible for a semi-real client: a local business. It can be a store, restaurant, bar, boutique, whatever. You must utilize their branding. If they have a logo, use it. If they have a particular tone or mood to their space, figure out how to translate that to the web and make it look good. Your job isn’t to reinvent this business; rather, you should convey the actual character of the institution through your site’s interface and design. In HTML/CSS create a website homepage and two subpages - 3-5 pages total.

				<h3>Criteria</h3>

				<h2>Project One Objectives</h2>
<p>There is a saying in web design: “Content is king.” Above all else, people use the web to get information. In fact, the original purpose of HTML wasn’t to make beautiful, artistic web pages, or to make super cool apps, but simply to organize and structure content. To this end, our job as designers is to create a system that can present our content in the best and most usable way possible.</p>

<p>Our first project is a 5-page mini site—one homepage and four details pages—that will showcase a small set of items that are interesting or personally relevant to the student. This site should highlight the similarities between the various items, visually and informationally, while allowing each item to retain its individual characteristics and values. At the same time, the site should maintain a cohesive visual language that encompasses and emphasizes the set as a whole.</p>
